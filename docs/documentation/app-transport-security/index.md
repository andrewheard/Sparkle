## App Transport Security

Apple has deprecated insecure HTTP in macOS 10.11 (El Capitan). Applications compiled with 10.11 SDK are by default **blocked from using HTTP** and will not be able to download any updates over HTTP. You **must** either:

* Switch to HTTPS entirely. Change the appcast URL in Info.plist and download URLs in the appcast to use HTTPS. This is recommended, and you can get free certificates from [Let's Encrypt](//letsencrypt.org/) or [AWS Certificate Manager](//aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/).

* Add an exception to Info.plist in your app if you can't stop using HTTP yet. [The exception properties are in Apple's documentation](//developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/).

If you don't do this, your app will not be able to download updates on macOS El Capitan, and your users will be stuck with an old version forever.

App Transport Security has other specific requirements too, so please test updating your app on 10.11 even if you already are serving over HTTPS!
