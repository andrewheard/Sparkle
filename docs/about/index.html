      <h2>About Sparkle</h2>
      <p>Sparkle is an easy-to-use software update framework for macOS applications. It delivers updates using <a href="/documentation/publishing/">appcasting</a>, a term used to refer to the practice of using RSS to distribute update information and release notes.</p>
      <p>Sparkle was originally created by <a href="//andymatuschak.org">Andy Matuschak</a> in 2006, and eventually went on to become the de-facto standard for macOS application updates, used by thousands of applications including Evernote, Oracle Java, Mailbox.app, SourceTree, TeamViewer, VLC Media Player, X11.app, and many, many more.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2013, Andy stopped development of Sparkle and handed over maintainership to the newly formed Sparkle Project, a <a href="//github.com/orgs/{{ site.github_username }}/people">group of developers</a> dedicated to managing and maintaining the official Sparkle open source project going forward. The Sparkle Project currently develops and maintains Sparkle on <a href="//github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/Sparkle">GitHub</a> with the help of dozens of valued contributors.</p>
